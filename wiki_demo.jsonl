{"title": "COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Act 2021", "desc": "The COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Act 2021 is an Act of Parliament to provide a legal framework for the New Zealand Government's COVID-19 Protection Framework and vaccination mandates. The bill was introduced under urgency and passed in law on 23 November 2021. While the bill was supported by the Labour Government and their Green coalition partners, it was opposed by the opposition National, ACT, and Māori parties, which criticised the rushed and divisive nature of the legislation and claimed that vulnerable communities would be adversely affected.\n\nKey points\nAs an omnibus bill, the COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Act 2021 amends the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 and the Employment Relations Act 2000 to give the Government and employers greater mandate to require employees to receive COVID-19 vaccines. The Bill also has a sunset clause for the repeal of the provisions of the COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Act 2021 on the date that the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 is repealed.\n\nCOVID-19 Public Health Response Act\nThe COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Act introduces the following amendments:\nSection 5(3) allows the Director-General of Health to issue a notice specifying COVID-19 vaccination exemption criteria and the required doses for each COVID-19 vaccine or combination of COVID-19 vaccines.\nSection 9 allows the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety, the Minister for COVID-19 Response, or any minister under any warrant or the authority of the Prime Minister to make COVID-19 orders under Section 11.\nThe amended Section 11 specifies several orders that can be made under the Act including ordering someone to stay in specific premises, permitting entry to specific premises, restricting travel and movement, restricting work carrying out by infected workers, the dosage of COVID-19 vaccines, and the regulation of COVID-19 vaccine certificates.\nSection 17 requires the Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) to keep vaccination records, prevent affected persons (other than an exempt or authorised person) to carry out specified work unless vaccinated.\nSection 23a gives authorised enforcement persons the power to direct person to produce evidence of compliance with a specified COVID-19 measures.\nSection 33AA allows the Governor-General at the recommendation of the Prime Minister to make regulations prescribing an assessment tool that an PCBU may use to ensure that workers are vaccinated and required to undergo medical examination or testing for COVID-19.\nSection 33AB allows PCBU to assess that workers are vaccinated and undergo medical examination or testing for COVID-19. The PCBU must also take steps to protect the worker's personal information.\nSection 34B states that personal information may not be held, stored, used, or disclosed by the person except for the purposes of ascertaining whether an individual has been vaccinated, issued with a COVID-19 vaccination certificate, or are complying with the Public Health Response Act, a COVID-19 health order, and the Health Act 1956.\nRecognises the My Vaccine Pass and International Travel Vaccination Certificate as COVID-19 vaccination certificates.\n\nEmployment Relations Act 2000\nA new Schedule 3A gives employees paid-time off for COVID-19 vaccinations.\nSchedule 3A  allows for the termination of employment agreements for failing to comply with vaccination mandates under the requirements of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 or a COVID-19 order.\n\nHistory\nMinister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins introduced the COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Bill during its first reading on 23 November 2021. The bill passed its first reading by a margin of 85 to 35. The Labour, Green, and ACT parties supported the bill while the National and Te Paati Māori (Māori Party) opposed it. National's COVID-19 spokesperson Chris Bishop and fellow National MPs Scott Simpson, and Penny Simmonds objected to the bill on the grounds that it was rushed and lacked a select committee process. Labour MPs Hipkins, Liz Craig, Tracey McLellan, and Green MP Elizabeth Kerekere defended the bill, claiming that it supported the Government's COVID-19 Protection Framework (traffic-light system) and vaccination efforts. ACT leader David Seymour initially supported the bill as part of a constructive approach to supporting the Government's COVID-19 response while expressing concerns about the bill's vague language relating to business operations. Te Paati Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer objected to the bill on the grounds that the Government's vaccination mandate and traffic light framework did not comply with the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nDuring the in-committee stage, Parliament rejected several amendments by National MPs regarding vaccination policies, laboratory testing, easing travel restrictions on the basis of negative COVID-19 tests, exemptions for places of worship, funeral services, and tangihanga, and New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and human rights safeguards.\n\nDuring the third reading, ACT leader David Seymour joined the National Party in criticising the legislation, describing it as a \"constitutional outrage\" and attacking the Government's management of the COVID-19 pandemic and economy. Te Paati Māori co-leader Ngarewa-Packer opposed the bill, claiming that the Government's COVID-19 Protection Framework would endanger Māori lives and well-being. Labour and Green MPs, particularly McLellan and Kerekere defended the Government's traffic light system and vaccine passes. The bill passed its final reading by a margin 75 (Labour and Greens) to 45 votes (National, ACT, Māori).\n\nResponses\nPrior to its passage, Human Rights Commission chief Paul Hunt described the COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Bill as \"highly problematic\" both constitutionally and in terms of New Zealand's human rights and Treaty of Waitangi obligations. He also opined that the Bill should be subject to a full parliamentary select committee as soon as it had passed into law.\n\nVictoria University of Wellington law Professor Dr. Dean Knight was supportive of the legislation but expressed concern about its rapid passage. While the Ministry of Justice advised Attorney-General David Parker that the bill was consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, its lawyers expressed concern about the \"extremely shot frame of time\" relating to the legislation's passage.\n\nIn early December 2021, Attorney-General Parker defended the hasty passage of the law, stating that \"it would have been impossible to avoid a 24-hour urgent lawmaking spree.\" Parker also said that New Zealand should not allow the choices of the unvaccinated minority to hold back its progress in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn 3 December 2021, University of Auckland commercial law Associate Professor Gehan Gunasekara along with Dr Marcin Betkier and Kathryn Dalziel of the Privacy Foundation New Zealand expressed concern about the lack of a select committee process that would have allowed public consultation  and the opaque language relating to the protection of COVID-19 contact tracing and vaccination information. They also expressed concerns about the protection of contact tracing information and the safety of software used for storing the My Vaccine Pass software on phones.\n\nNotes and references\n\nExternal links\n\n2021 in New Zealand law\nStatutes of New Zealand\nCOVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand\nHealth in New Zealand\nLaw associated with the COVID-19 pandemic"}
{"title": "Nathan Hale (colonel)", "desc": "Nathan Hale (September 23, 1743 – September 23, 1780) was an American Revolutionary War officer who fought in the Battle of Lexington and Concord, Battle of Bunker Hill, Siege of Fort Ticonderoga, and Battle of Hubbardton. Hale was taken prisoner by the British at Hubbardton and died in prison on September 23, 1780 at New Utrecht, Brooklyn, New York.\n\nFamily and early life \nNathan Hale was born in Hampstead, New Hampshire, son of Moses and Elizabeth (Wheeler) Hale. He was a descendant of Thomas Hale of Newbury, Massachusetts, who arrived in 1637 from Watton-At-Stone, Hertfordshire, England as the latter part of the Winthrop Fleet and Great Migration.  There is no known relation between Colonel Nathan Hale and Captain Nathan Hale, the American spy hanged by the British in 1776.\n\nIn his teens, Hale moved with his family to the area that would become Rindge, New Hampshire. He married Abigail Grout, daughter of Col. John and Joanna (Boynton) Grout of Lunenburg, Massachusetts. When the town of Rindge was organized in 1768, Hale was chosen the first constable of the town, and served as the moderator of the annual town meetings in 1773, 1774 and 1775\n\nService in the American Revolution \nIn 1774, Hale became the captain of a militia company of minutemen.  Once Hale was told of the Battle of Lexington on April 19, 1775, he and his fifty men marched to Cambridge, Massachusetts to join the Army of Observation.\n\nOn June 2, 1775, Hale was commissioned as a captain in the 3rd New Hampshire Regiment. They fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775.  The Army of Observation (consisting of militiamen from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island) had about 2,400 men and the British had over 3,000. The colonies suffered 450 casualties and the British suffered 1,054 casualties in what has been described as a British Pyrrhic victory.\n\nHale was promoted to lieutenant-colonel of the 2nd New Hampshire Regiment on November 8, 1776. Achieving success in battle, he was again promoted to colonel on April 2, 1777. In the same year he served under Major General Arthur St. Clair at the Siege of Fort Ticonderoga in early July. \n\nOn July 4, 1777, the British managed to place two cannon and soldiers atop Mount Defiance, overlooking the fort. With no defense against artillery placed on the hill, General St. Clair and the officers decided to evacuate the fort in the dark of night. Hale's regiment and other stragglers from the retreating army were discovered by pursuing British forces at the Battle of Hubbardton a few days later, and he was taken prisoner on July 7, 1777. \n\nHis surrender and subsequent treatment by the British was the subject of controversy. Hale was later released on limited parole by the British, on the condition that he was not allowed to serve in the Army nor return to the enemy lines. He returned to Rindge, New Hampshire on July 20, 1777. Since he had not been exchanged as a prisoner of war, Hale was returned to prison on June 14, 1779. He hoped to be able to exonerate himself, but he died in prison on September 23, 1780 in New Utrecht, Brooklyn.\n\nAfter his death\n\"Thomas Moore of Chelsea, who was a soldier in his regiment, told me repeatedly in my boyhood that my grandfather was \"as brave a man as ever trod shoe-leather\" and added always that he \"was the finest-looking man I (Moore) ever set eyes on.\" His wife was a woman of great intelligence, executive ability and energy of character whom I well remember in a wonderfully vigorous old age.\" After the age of 90, she was still a great reader, interested in the news and politics of the day. In her latter years, she drew a pension of $600 per year as the widow of a colonel.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n1743 births\n1780 deaths\nAmerican Revolutionary War prisoners of war held by Great Britain\nContinental Army officers from New Hampshire\nAmerican people who died in prison custody\nPrisoners who died in British military detention\nPeople from Rindge, New Hampshire"}

{"title": "He Is We", "desc": "He Is We is an indie pop band from Tacoma, Washington, fronted by lead singer, Rachel Taylor.\n\nCareer\n\n2008–2011: Formation and early years\n\nRachel Taylor and Trevor Kelly met while working at Ted Brown Music Company, a music store in their hometown of Tacoma, Washington. Rachel and Trevor were the founding duo that comprised He Is We. The touring members initially included Harrison Allen (drums), Carman Kubanda (guitar), and Aaron Campbell (keyboard/guitar). Later, Jake Randle (bass guitar) replaced Aaron Campbell. He Is We initially relied on social networking, using websites such as Myspace and Facebook. In 2009, they were named PureVolume's number one unsigned band of the year. This online presence and the release of an album of old demos in February 2010 led to their signing with Universal Motown Records. Prior to the release of My Forever, He Is We toured with The Rocket Summer.  Their debut album My Forever hit number 6 on Billboards Heatseekers Album Charts.  On their website, He Is We says that the start of the band came from \"the idea that someone who you pass everyday can influence the rest of your life ... and you would never know.\"\n\n2012–2017: Lineup changes, She Is We, and other releases\nIn early 2012, Rachel Taylor was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, and Stevie Scott filled in for the remainder of the tour. Despite being officially replaced by Scott in August, and having stated \"Walking away from the label would mean that I would be walking away from the He Is We name but I would regain my freedom to be me. I would regain my ability to connect with you fans 100% with my words. I wouldn't feel like I can only release what THEY want me to. I could be the soul that longs to escape this dreary vessel.\", she returned to the band at the end of October 2012, while Trevor Kelly departed to form his own band.\n\nAfter Kelly left with Stevie Scott in 2012, Rachel continued to pursue the project herself. She said that she planned to release new music and tour in 2013. In 2013, their song \"All About Us\", with Aaron Gillespie, was included on The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones soundtrack. Despite rumors surfaced of her changing the name of He Is We and moving in a new direction, she insisted that the rumors were completely untrue and she would do no such thing. However, on June 23, 2014, Rachel Taylor broke away as a solo artist with her debut EP, Come Alive.\n\nIn August 2015, Taylor announced she was launching \"a He Is We 2.0\" with Adamm Mitchell entitled She Is We. On October 22, 2015, She Is We released their first single \"Boomerang\" and announced that their debut album War would be available for pre-order on October 23, 2015. It was released by Vanguard Records on March 18, 2016. War was made available to stream prior to release on Billboard's website on March 11, 2016.\n\nIn August 2016, Taylor announced that she had reunited with bandmate Trevor Kelly and that they were writing new songs. In September 2016, Taylor and Kelly announced that they would be touring together.\n\nIn August 2017, touring members McBride, Mitchell and Chamberlain left the band and in September 2017, touring guitarist Macy Santa Maria accused Taylor of sexually assaulting her. Taylor responded with her own statement, denying that a sexual assault had occurred and alleging that Santa Maria's statement mischaracterized her actions and the nature of sexual assault. Following Santa Maria's allegations, He Is We were removed as support for Secondhand Serenade's fall 2017 tour. On June 4, 2019, Rachel Taylor was found not guilty of sexual assault following a one-day trial in Jamestown, North Dakota. Taylor was found guilty of a separate disorderly conduct misdemeanor charge, which carries up to a $1,500 fine and potentially 30 days in jail.\n \nIn March 2017, He is We released Fall out of Line to iTunes, which contains old demos and re-released songs. The band's \"For the Runaways\" tour (March and April 2017) promoted the album by focusing on older He Is We songs. Trevor Kelly did not tour with the band during the \"For the Runaways\" tour, with Hans Hessburg filling in on acoustic guitar.\n\n2018–present: He Is We Chapter One and Hold My Heart\n\nIn March 2018, He is We released He Is We Chapter One digitally, which contains re-released songs. Rachel Taylor announced in February 2018 that she was back in studio and that she would release a new He Is We EP in March or April 2018.\n\nHe Is We announced they would be touring with Vendetta Red in March 2018.\n\nHe Is We's new EP, Hold My Heart, was released on April 10, 2018.\n\nRachel Taylor has recently announced that He Is We will be back with the new single \"Amazing Grace\", The single will come out on February 14, 2020.\n\nDiscography \nA Mess it Grows (2009)\nOld Demos (2009)\nTrack list:\n I Wouldn't Mind\n Blame It On The Rain (Acoustic Guitar)\n Breathe\n Pardon Me (Acoustic Guitar)\n Blame It on the Rain (Acoustic)\n Give It All\n Happily Ever After (Acoustic)\n Light A Way\n Pardon Me\n Pour Me Out\n Too Beautiful\n Radio\nNote: Only studio recorded demos listed.\nMy Forever (2010)\nAcoustic/Live EP (2010)\nTrack list:\n And Run (acoustic/live)\n Happily Ever After (acoustic/live)\n Everything You Do (acoustic/live)\n Blame It on the Rain (acoustic/live)\n All About Us (acoustic/live)\n Prove You Wrong (acoustic/live)\n Fall (acoustic/live)\n Forever and Ever (acoustic Live)\nSkip To the Good Part - EP (2011)\nTrack list:\n All About Us (feat.

{"title": "Shane van Gisbergen", "desc": "Shane Robert van Gisbergen (born 9 May 1989) is a New Zealand racing driver who competes in the Repco Supercars Championship. He currently drives the No. 97 Holden ZB Commodore for Triple Eight Race Engineering. \n\nVan Gisbergen has also forged a successful GT career, including a number of entries in the 24 Hours of Daytona for Alex Job Racing and competing in the Blancpain Endurance Series for McLaren with Von Ryan Racing and Garage 59. Van Gisbergen, with Álvaro Parente and Jonathon Webb, also won the 2016 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour for Tekno Autosports.\n\nHe and Paul Morris are the only drivers to have won all three major car racing events at Mount Panorama; the Bathurst 1000, Bathurst 6 Hour and Bathurst 12 Hour.\n\nNew Zealand racing history\nAfter competing in Motocross, Quarter Midgets and karts from 1998 to 2004, van Gisbergen placed third in the 2004/2005 New Zealand Formula First Championship and won the associated Rookie of the Year award. Van Gisbergen had previously obtained a Speedsport Star of Tomorrow Scholarship. A win in 2005/06 New Zealand Formula Ford Championship was accompanied by another Rookie of the Year title and was followed by a second-place finish in 2006/07 Toyota Racing Series.\n\nIn 2014, van Gisbergen co-drove to the BNT NZ Supertourers Hankook Super Series championship with primary driver Simon Evans. Shane won 7 of the 9 races in a total of the Endurance rounds including sweeping the entire Fuchs 500 weekend at Pukekohe Park Raceway with winning race #3 in spectacular fashion driving from 1 lap down.\nIn 2021, van Gisbergen won the New Zealand Grand Prix held as part of the Toyota Racing Series. The event is normally held for a global field however was restricted to a New Zealand-only field due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with van Gisbergen entering as a wildcard.\n\nSupercars Championship\n\nVan Gisbergen became the 200th driver to start a race in a V8 Supercar at the Jim Beam 400 at Oran Park Raceway in Round 8 of 2007. Driving for Team Kiwi Racing, van Gisbergen finished the first race in 20th position before improving to 13th for race 2 but then dropped down to 23rd in race 3. Having impressed in his 2007 races, van Gisbergen was picked up by Stone Brothers Racing in 2008. He would continue with the team for five seasons until 2012, securing a best of fourth in the championship in 2011. In late 2012, he announced he would be leaving V8 Supercars but in January it emerged that he was moving to Tekno Autosports at the start of the 2013 season. The move to Tekno proved fruitful, with van Gisbergen finishing runner-up in the championship in 2014.\n\nVan Gisbergen has also shown a strong pace at the series' most famous race, the Bathurst 1000. He was in the lead in the 2009 Bathurst 1000 until pitting on lap 108 when his car would not start, resulting in a 1:14 pit stop and losing him a number of positions in the race. A near-identical issue repeated itself in the 2014 edition, where with 10 laps to go – he stalled and the starter motor failed, costing him almost a certain victory and he finished 16th. Van Gisbergen had started the 2014 race from pole position, his first at the event.\n\nIn 2016, van Gisbergen moved to the successful Triple Eight Race Engineering team, alongside two of the most successful drivers in series history; Jamie Whincup and Craig Lowndes. Van Gisbergen won his first race for the team at the Tasmania SuperSprint in 2016, which was also Holden's 500th win in championship history. Alexandre Prémat joined van Gisbergen as co-driver in the Enduro Cup. The pairing went on to win the 2016 Enduro Cup, including three second-place finishes and Prémat's first race victory in the championship at the 2016 Castrol Gold Coast 600 and become the first non-Australian drivers combination to win. At Pukekohe, van Gisbergen became the first New Zealander to lift the trophy, named in honour of Jason Richards, who died of cancer in 2011 and he admitted the occasion got the better of him after crossing the finish line. He went on to win 8 races that season on the way to clinching the championship with a race to spare.\n\nIn 2017, Whincup and van Gisbergen joined again under the Red Bull Holden Racing Team banner. At Adelaide, he started his title defence with a commanding double-victory, and remained in contention during the campaign but he finished 4th in the championship. In 2018, van Gisbergen won both Race 1 and Race 2 at the Adelaide, driving a Holden Commodore ZB. At Townsville, van Gisbergen won at race 18 after Whincup marked the 10th running at race 17. On August 4, van Gisbergen won the Sydney SuperNight 300, the championship's first night race in 21 years, after a Safety Car ignited a thrilling final stint battle between Scott McLaughlin and the three Triple Eight Holdens. At Tailem Bend, van Gisbergen dominated the inaugural race at The Bend Motorsport Park, taking a near lights-to-flag win in Race 22. On September 16, at Sandown, Van Gisbergen finished 2nd alongside Earl Bamber, who is a double Le Mans 24 Hours winner. Van Gisbergen managed to controversially escape a penalty for spinning his wheels during a pit stop at the Auckland SuperSprint at Pukekohe.\n\nAt Newcastle, van Gisbergen was handed a 25-second post-race penalty, which saw his Saturday win in Newcastle stripped. Stewards confirmed the time penalty on Sunday morning following Saturday night's investigation into an alleged refueling breach at his third pitstop, which was taken under the safety car and dropping to fifth in the race result. Scott McLaughlin was declared the winner of the race. Van Gisbergen finished second at race 31 and in the points standings.\n\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic plagued Supercars season, he won the Bathurst 1000 with Garth Tander in what would be the final race for Holden after the manufacturer was closed by GM, marking the end of a historic period of Australian Motorsport.\n\nGT racing\n\nThrough his connections with Tekno Autosports sponsor Tony Quinn, van Gisbergen's first foray into GT racing was a guest co-drive in Quinn's team in the 2013 Australian GT Championship. In 2014, he entered both the 24 Hours of Daytona and the Bathurst 12 Hour for the first time, the latter again in partnership with Quinn, this time in a McLaren. His Daytona entry was with Alex Job Racing, where he finished 26th overall and sixth in the GTD class. He returned to Daytona in 2015 and 2016 with the team.\n\nHaving impressed in previous outings, in 2015 he entered the Blancpain Endurance Series in a McLaren 650S GT3 run by Von Ryan Racing. Racing in conjunction with his V8 Supercars commitments, he was forced to miss one round due to a date clash, however achieved two victories in the four races he entered. The team was dissolved after the 2015 season, and for the 2016 season, van Gisbergen moved to McLaren's new Garage 59 team. He will once again miss the final round of the championship at the Nürburgring in Germany due to the Sandown 500 V8 Supercar race being held on the same weekend. Van Gisbergen won the 2016 season with Côme Ledogar and Rob Bell having won the 3 Hours of Monza and the 1000 km Paul Ricard despite skipping the last round at the Nürburgring due to a clash with his Supercars Championship commitments.\n\nThrough his McLaren and Tekno Autosports connections, he drove one of Tekno's factory-supported McLaren 650S GT3s at the 2016 Bathurst 12 Hour. In qualifying on Saturday, van Gisbergen set the fastest ever officially recorded lap of the Mount Panorama Circuit to achieve pole position. He went on to set the fastest ever race lap on the way to securing victory alongside Álvaro Parente and Jonathon Webb.\n\nCareer results\n\nSupercars Championship results\n(Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nComplete Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup results\n\nComplete Intercontinental GT Challenge Series results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nComplete IMSA SportsCar Championship results\n\nComplete Bathurst 1000 results\n\nComplete Bathurst 12 Hour results\n\nComplete 24 Hours of Daytona results\n\nComplete Spa 24 Hours results\n\nComplete 12 Hours of Sebring results\n\nComplete V8 SuperTourer results\n\nBathurst 6 Hour\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Official Website\n Profile on Driver DataBase\n Profile on US Racing Reference\n Photo's, articles & Video's on Motorsport.Com\n\n1989 births\nLiving people\nNew Zealand speedway (auto racing) drivers\nNew Zealand people of Dutch descent\nNew Zealand racing drivers\nToyota Racing Series drivers\nSportspeople from Auckland\nPeople educated at Saint Kentigern College\nV8SuperTourer drivers\nSupercars Championship drivers\n24 Hours of Daytona drivers\nWeatherTech SportsCar Championship drivers\nBlancpain Endurance Series drivers\n24 Hours of Spa drivers\nBathurst 1000 winners"}
{"title": "Grand Ducal Gendarmerie (Luxembourg)", "desc": "The Grand Ducal Gendarmerie (; Luxembourgish: Groussherzoglech Gendarmerie) was a national law enforcement corps in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg with both civil and military duties. It merged on January 1st, 2000 with local police forces under state authority to form the Grand Ducal Police (Luxembourgish: Groussherzoglech Police; French: Police Grand-Ducale).\n\nHistory\n\nFormation\nThe Grand Ducal Gendarmerie was formed on February 3, 1733, \"to fight the plague of the vagrants and people without consent\".\n\nFrench rule and transition \nLuxembourg was incorporated into France as the Département des Forêts from 1795 to 1813 and the \"Gendarmerie Nationale\" system was applied. The law of the \"28 Germinal, Year VI\", was to remain the basis of the Luxembourgish Gendarmerie. In 1805, the name of the \"National Gendarmerie\" was changed to \"Imperial Gendarmerie\".\n\nTransitionally, after Napoleon's defeat at Leipzig in 1813, Luxembourg became part of the province of Middle-Rhine, administered by Prussia. The Gendarmerie being in complete disarray, the ordinance of 18 February 1814 replaced it with a government militia, with 3 officers and 106 sub-officers and soldiers.\n\nKingdom of the Netherlands \nFrom 1815 to 1830, Luxembourg was ruled by the King of the Netherlands, as was Belgium. The law of 1814, creating a Corps de Maréchaussée (Constabulary Corps) in Belgium on the model of the French Gendarmerie, was extended to Luxembourg. \n\nAfter the Belgian Revolution in October 1830, Luxembourg was divided into two parts: the larger part formed the Belgian Province de Luxembourg; the other became the present-day Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, still ruled by the Netherlands. Until 1839, it was controlled by the Dutch Constabulary. \n\nLuxembourg was made an independent state (still ruled by the Dutch King in personal union) by the Treaty of London of 19 April, and the creation of a local police force was necessary. The Ordinance of 29 January 1840 created the \"Grand Duchy Royal Gendarmerie\". On 1842, it lost its autonomy and was incorporated into the federal contingent (of the German Confederation). Until 1877, the commandant of the Gendarmerie was under the authority of the commander of the contingent.\n\nIndependence \n\nThe Royal-Grand Ducal decree of 25 August 1863 changed the name into the 'Company of the Grand Duchy Royal Gendarmerie' (), and increased its size to 108 men. In 1877, the Gendarmerie was separated from the contingent. \n\nThe law of 16 February 1881 created a \"Force Armée\", consisting of a company of gendarmes and a company of volunteers, under the command of a major. In 1902, a criminal brigade was created in the Gendarmerie, in order to help the judicial authorities in dealing with crimes and misdemeanours. This brigade was reorganised and reinforced in 1911. By grand-ducal decree of 30 November 1929, it received the name of \"Service de la Sûreté Publique\".\n\nWorld War 2 and the Cold War \nIn 1940, under the German occupation, the Gendarmerie was dissolved and its members were integrated in the services of the polizei deployed into the occupied countries on Eastern Europe. During the Battle of the Bulge, 15 gendarmes assisted American troops with defending the town of Diekirch. The law of 23 July 1952 constituted the legal bases of the modern gendarmerie.

{"title": "Tanith Belbin White", "desc": "Tanith Jessica Louise Belbin  (born July 11, 1984) is a Canadian-American ice dancer and Olympic program host for NBC Sports. Though born in Canada, she holds dual citizenship and has competed for the United States since she began skating with Benjamin Agosto in 1998. With Agosto, Belbin is the 2006 Olympic silver medalist, four-time World medalist, three-time Four Continents champion (2004–2006), and five-time U.S. champion (2004–2008).\n\nPersonal life\nTanith Belbin was born in Kingston, Ontario, and raised in Kirkland, Quebec. In 1998, she moved to the Detroit area in the United States and received an immigrant worker visa in 2000. Due to immigration rules at the time, she did not receive a green card until July 2002 and would not have been granted U.S. citizenship until 2007. An amendment was passed which allowed Belbin to be sworn in as an American citizen on December 31, 2005. The amendment was authored by Senator Carl Levin who stated, \"This amendment corrects an anomaly in the law that unfairly disadvantaged some people who had begun their naturalization process before 2002. Tanith Belbin began her naturalization process in 2000, but due to changes that were made to the law in 2002, the process has taken significantly longer than it would have if she had filed her paperwork 2 years later.\"\n\nBelbin lived and trained in Canton, Michigan, for many years, before moving to Aston, Pennsylvania. After 2010, Belbin decided to move back to Michigan to attend Eastern Michigan University and be closer to friends and family, including then-boyfriend Charlie White. Belbin and White became engaged in June 2014 and were married on April 25, 2015. In December 2017, their son was born.\n\nHer father, Charles Belbin, is a public relations manager, while her mother, Michelle (née McKinlay) Belbin, is a former figure skater (who trained in St. John's, Newfoundland under Rolf Adomeit), coach, and costume designer. Michelle made some of Tanith's costumes.\n\nCareer \nTanith Belbin began skating when she was almost three and started ice dancing at about eight or nine. She competed both as a pair skater and ice dancer in Canada before deciding to concentrate completely on ice dancing. She was introduced to ice dancing by Paul Wirtz and competed with partner Liam Dougherty. Her pairs partner was Ben Barruco, with whom she placed 2nd at the novice level at the 1997 Canadian Championships. She did not compete with either partner internationally.\n\nPartnership with Agosto \nAfter a year without a partner in Canada, Belbin moved to Detroit in 1998, where she was partnered with Benjamin Agosto by their coach Igor Shpilband. In the 1999–2000 season, they won a pair of medals on the ISU Junior Grand Prix series and finished 4th at the JGP Final. They went on to win the U.S. junior national title and then took the bronze medal at the 2000 World Junior Championships. In 2000–2001, Belbin / Agosto competed again on the JGP series, taking gold in all three of their events including the Final. They appeared on the senior level at the 2001 U.S. Championships and won the silver medal, qualifying them for their first senior World Championships, where they finished 17th.\n\nIn 2001–2002, Belbin / Agosto made their senior Grand Prix debut and won another silver medal at the U.S. Championships, which would have qualified them for the 2002 Winter Olympics if Belbin had been an American citizen. Instead, Belbin and Agosto were sent to all the other ISU Championships for which they were eligible: Four Continents, Junior Worlds, and Worlds. They won the 2002 World Junior Championships, completing their set of medals from that event. Following that season, Agosto aged out of juniors.\n\nBelbin / Agosto won the 2004 U.S. national title and would go on to repeat four times. At Nationals in 2005, the last year of the 6.0 system, Belbin / Agosto received straight perfect sixes for presentation in their free dance. Of the 30 6.0s given out in ice dance at U.S. Nationals, Belbin / Agosto have 14 of them. Their total 6.0 count at the U.S. Championships is second only to Michelle Kwan (38).\n\nBelbin / Agosto won the silver medal at the 2005 World Championships.\n\nFans of Belbin / Agosto wrote letters and signed petitions asking for a special act of Congress to allow Belbin to become a citizen in time for her to compete at the 2006 Winter Olympics, where many believed they could win a medal. In addition, it was Belbin / Agosto who earned a third spot for the U.S. in the Olympic ice dancing event, by winning a medal at the 2005 World Championships, without which the U.S. would have had only two spots. However, the mother of fellow American ice dancer David Mitchell sent a letter to Senator Hillary Clinton, asking her to vote against it. She believed that it was unfair to bend the requirements for U.S. citizenship for Belbin, when other \"aliens of extraordinary ability\" were denied expedited citizenship. Ultimately, by a special act of Congress sponsored by Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) that passed on December 28, 2005, which President George W. Bush signed on December 31, 2005, Belbin became a naturalized citizen, allowing her to compete for the United States at the 2006 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn January 2006, Belbin / Agosto won their third consecutive national title and qualified for the Olympics. At the Turin Olympics, Belbin and Agosto won the silver medal in ice dancing, the first American ice dancers to win an Olympic medal in 30 years. They went on to win the bronze at Worlds.\n\nBelbin / Agosto began the 2006–2007 season with a free dance called That's Entertainment but arrived at Nationals with a new program to the music of Amelie. They won gold at Nationals, the silver medal at Four Continents, and the bronze at Worlds.\n\nIn 2007–2008, they won gold medals at both Skate America and Cup of China which qualified them for the Grand Prix Final, where they took the silver medal. They won their 5th national title and then placed 4th at the 2008 Worlds after a fall by Belbin in the compulsory dance. Belbin / Agosto were regular cast members of the Champions on Ice tour from 2004 until COI went out of business following the 2007 season. They were guest stars on part of the 2008 Stars on Ice tour.\n\nIn April 2008, Belbin / Agosto left Igor Shpilband, who had coached them for their entire partnership, and began working with the married coaching team of Natalia Linichuk and Gennadi Karponosov at the IceWorks Skating Complex in Aston, Pennsylvania. In addition to teaching different technique, Linichuk advised Belbin to gain 10 pounds and develop some muscles in order to skate faster and more fluidly. This also gave Belbin more core strength to hold her positions better, thus making lifts easier for Agosto.\n\nBelbin / Agosto began the 2008–2009 season at the 2008 Skate America and 2008 Cup of China, winning silver at both competitions. They withdrew from the 2008–2009 ISU Grand Prix Final after the original dance due to a back injury to Agosto. They withdrew from the 2009 U.S. Championships before the event began due to Agosto's injury. They were named to the team to the 2009 World Championships. At Worlds, they won the original dance and placed second in the compulsory and free dances to win the silver medal overall.\n\nBelbin / Agosto won both their Grand Prix events in the 2009–10 season: the 2009 Cup of China and the 2009 Skate America. They withdrew from the Grand Prix Final for medical reasons. At the 2010 U.S. Championships, they were unable to reclaim their national title, finishing second behind Meryl Davis and Charlie White. Belbin and Agosto were nominated to represent the United States at the 2010 Winter Olympics. They finished 4th in the Olympic ice dancing event. They did not compete at the 2010 World Championships.\n\nOn June 10, 2010, Belbin / Agosto announced their retirement from eligible skating. They have continued to skate together in ice shows.\n\nOn December 15, 2015, U.S. Figure Skating announced Belbin and Agosto would be members of the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame Class of 2016. The induction ceremony was held on January 22, 2016 at the 2016 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.\n\nPost-competitive career\nBelbin has worked as a commentator for ice dance competitions on Universal Sports Network, the ABC show Skating with the Stars, and for icenetwork.com. She has also worked as a commentator for four seasons of Curling Night in America, a NBCSN program that broadcasts a made-for-television curling competition.\n\nIn October 2011 Belbin competed as a pro on season 3 of Battle of the Blades paired with Boyd Devereaux; the pair placed 3rd in the competition.\n\nBelbin also works as a choreographer.\n\nPrograms\n\n(with Agosto)\n\nCompetitive highlights\n\n(ice dancing with Agosto)\n\n(Pair skating with Barruco)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n1984 births\nLiving people\nAmerican female ice dancers\nAnglophone Quebec people\nBattle of the Blades participants\nCanadian emigrants to the United States\nCanadian female ice dancers\nFigure skaters at the 2006 Winter Olympics\nFigure skaters at the 2010 Winter Olympics\nFour Continents Figure Skating Championships medalists\nMedalists at the 2006 Winter Olympics\nOlympic Games broadcasters\nOlympic medalists in figure skating\nOlympic silver medalists for the United States in figure skating\nPeople from Canton, Michigan\nPeople from Kirkland, Quebec\nSportspeople from Kingston, Ontario\nWorld Figure Skating Championships medalists\nWorld Junior Figure Skating Championships medalists\nCompetitors at the 2001 Goodwill Games\n21st-century American women"}
{"title": "Mathews' Chinese–English Dictionary", "desc": "A Chinese–English Dictionary: Compiled for the China Inland Mission by R. H. Mathews or Mathews' Chinese–English Dictionary, edited by the Australian Congregationalist missionary Robert Henry Mathews (1877–1970), was the standard Chinese–English dictionary for decades. Mathews originally intended his dictionary to be a revision of Frederick W. Baller's out-of-print An Analytical Chinese–English Dictionary, but ended up compiling a new dictionary. Mathews copied, without acknowledgment, from the two editions of Herbert Giles's A Chinese–English Dictionary.\n\nThe 1,250-page first edition contained 7,783 Chinese character head entries, alphabetically collated by romanized syllabic order in modified Wade–Giles system, and includes 104,000 words and phrases taken from the classics, general literature, and news media. Owing to a World War II shortage of Chinese–English dictionaries, Harvard University Press published a revised American edition, which included 15,000 corrections, revisions, and new examples.\n\nHistory\n\nAfter studying lithography at the Working Men's College of Melbourne, the Australian Robert Henry Mathews started a printing business, but in 1906 he abandoned it to become a  Congregationalist missionary and join the China Inland Mission (CIM). Mathews first sailed to China in 1908, and the CIM assigned him to stations in Henan, Anhui, where he became interested in studying the regional varieties of Chinese, and Sichuan.\n\nIn 1928, Mathews was assigned to the China Inland Mission headquarters in Shanghai, where he could fully utilize his printing and Chinese linguistic skills. They commissioned him to revise two out-of-print China Inland Mission publications by Frederick W. Baller, the Analytical Chinese-English Dictionary and Mandarin Primer, both printed in 1900. Robert Mathews and his wife Violet worked intensively to complete the Chinese-English Dictionary in 1931, after only 3 years (he calls it a \"rush job\"), and then, for westerners seeking a \"working knowledge\" of Chinese, the 1938 Kuoyü Primer in 7 years during the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1943, Japanese occupation troops interned Mathews, commandeered the CIM compound in Shanghai to use as their headquarters, and destroyed both the dictionary printing plates and Mathews' manuscripts and proofs for a revised edition. \n\nThe 1931 first edition, which began as a revision of Baller's Analytical Dictionary, ended up as \"a 'new' dictionary\". Robert Mathew's preface says that in the 30 years since Baller's outdated dictionary, the \"influx of modern inventions and the advance of scientific knowledge\" in China have introduced many neologisms. Consequently Mathews compiled a replacement dictionary, keeping in mind Baller's original objective, \"to supply the demand for a dictionary at once portable and inexpensive and at the same time sufficiently large to meet the wants of an ordinary student.\" Mathews' Chinese title is Maishi Han-Ying da cidian 麥氏漢英大辭典 \"Mai's Chinese-English dictionary\".\n\nInstead of adopting the usual Wade-Giles system for romanizing Chinese pronunciation, Baller created his own system, now referred to as Baller's system or the China Inland Mission system. Another shortcoming of Baller's dictionary was inconsistent treatment of Chinese varietal pronunciations, furnishing \"the sounds of characters as given in West China\" (Southwestern Mandarin and Chang-Du dialect) and ignoring the variety \"spoken in the south-eastern.\n\nAfter Japanese troops in Shanghai destroyed the Mathews' dictionary original printing plates, the lack of copies became an urgent matter for English-speaking Allies of World War II. The Harvard–Yenching Institute said the need for Chinese dictionaries in America had \"grown from chronic to acute\", and selected Mathews' lexicon as one of two \"practical dictionaries\" to revise and reprint for \"the immediate demands of American students\". Both photolithographic reproductions were retitled: Henry Courtenay Fenn's (1926) The Five Thousand Dictionary was Fenn's Pocket Dictionary (November 1942) and Mathews' A Chinese-English Dictionary… was Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary (March 1943), which was a \"pirated\" edition since Mathews never received any payment. The revised edition made a total of 15,000 changes to the original, \"errors have been corrected, pronunciations and definitions revised, and new entries inserted\". In addition, the Chinese-American linguist Yuen Ren Chao wrote an Introduction on Pronunciation. The dictionary was reduced in size from 8x11 to 7x10 inches. In 1944, Harvard University Press also published Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary Revised English Index. By 1984, the Press had sold more than 45,000 copies of Mathew's dictionary.\n\nUp through the 1970s, English-speaking students of Chinese relied chiefly on Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary. Scholars published several companion pieces for Mathews. Tse-tsung Chow (周策縱) of the University of Wisconsin compiled in 1972 A New Index to Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary, Based on the \"Chung\" system for Arranging Chinese Characters, referring to the obsolescent zhōng 衷 indexing system based on character strokes. Olov Bertil Anderson of Lund University published in 1972 A companion volume to R. H. Mathews' Chinese-English dictionary, which went into a 335-page third revision in 1988. Harry M. Branch developed a Five Willows system and published in 1973 Mathews' and Fenn re-indexed. Raymond Huang wrote in 1981 a descriptive Mandarin Pronunciation Explained with Diagrams: A Companion to R. H. Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary.\n\nMathews' Chinese-English dictionary has been reprinted time and again—but without his authorization—and became so prominent that it is often simply called Mathews. The English diplomat and sinologist Endymion Wilkinson says Mathews' continues in use, especially by students of Classical Chinese, but for other purposes it has been outdated by excellent dictionaries such as John DeFrancis' (1996) ABC Chinese-English Dictionary.\n\nIn the history of Chinese lexicography, Mathews' dictionary was the last major compilation in the tradition of Christian missionaries in China. It began with Robert Morrison's (1815-1823) A Dictionary of the Chinese Language, and continued with Walter Henry Medhurst's (1842) Chinese and English Dictionary and Samuel Wells Williams' (1874) A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language—excepting the anti-clericalist Herbert Giles' (1892, 1912) A Chinese-English Dictionary. Thus, Mathews' dictionary signifies the end of missionaries compiling Chinese bilingual dictionaries and the beginning of a new era for Chinese and English bilingual dictionaries, \"based on stronger theoretical underpinnings and more sophisticated information technology as from the latter part of the twentieth century\".\n\nContent\nMathews not only revised Baller's dictionary but augmented and innovated it as well. Baller included 6,089 character head entries (not including variant characters) and 40,000 word and phrase examples; Mathews increased the number of character entries to \"7,785\" (the last entry is number 7,783 yün 薀 \"Hippuris or mare's tail.\") and gave over 104,000 usage examples drawn from \"the classics, general literature, magazines, newspapers, advertisements, legal documents, and many other sources\", including technical terms \"relating to motors, electricity, aviation, [and] wireless\". \n\nMathews changed Baller's romanization system to Wade–Giles, and omitted Baller's explanations of Chinese character construction. For example, saying Number 5047, tao4 道 \"A road; a way; a path…\" comes \"From Nos. 1036; 4771\", that is choh 辵 or 辶 \"Walking. The 162nd Radical\" and sheo 首 \"The head. A chief; a leader; first. The 185th Radical.\"\n\nMathews's 1164-page dictionary is collated alphabetically according to the Wade–Giles system of romanization. It includes two appendices comprising 61 pages. Appendix A has tables including 29 Chinese dynasties, the celestial stems and earthly branches, Chinese calendar, and solar terms. Appendix B gives a list of the 214 Kangxi radicals, a radical-and-stroke index, and, for the dictionary's frustrated user, a helpful list of characters having obscure radicals.\n\nScholars agree that Mathews's dictionary closely resembles Herbert Giles's Chinese–English Dictionary, but differ over the degree of copying. Aylmer says many definitions \"are taken, without acknowledgment\" from Giles, Wilkinson says Mathews's is \"based on\" Giles's dictionary, and Kroll says Matthews's is \"heavily indebted\" to Giles's.\n\nMathews occasionally cites Giles's dictionary, such as for the Chinese exonym Xiáyōusī 黠憂斯 \"Kyrgyz people\". \n\"HSIA 黠 Artful; wily. Clever; sharp. … 黠憂斯 The Kirghiz, lit red-yellow face; name given by the Ouigours, in allusion to the red hair, white complexions, and green eyes of the Kirghiz.\"\n\"HSIA 黠 Crafty; artful. … [adding a meaning] Transliterating particle. 黠憂斯 ancient name for the Kirghiz:—lit. \"red-yellow faces, in allusion to their red hair, white complexion and green eyes.\" Giles.\"\nThere are many cases where Mathews uses Giles's dictionary without citation, such as the Kuí  夔 \"legendary dragon-like monster with one foot\". The problem began with Giles's Zhuangzi translation, \"The walrus said to the centipede …\", which notes, \"'Walrus' is of course an analogue. But for the one leg, the description given by a commentator of the creature mentioned in the text applies with significant exactitude.\" Giles's dictionary translates kui as \"A one-legged creature; a walrus. Grave; reverential.\" Mathews's dictionary gives \"A one-legged monster; a walrus; Grave, respectful\".\n\nAs noted above, the 1943 second edition Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary adds an introduction on Chinese pronunciation and over 15,000 editorial changes. Furthermore, it gives a 5-page List of Syllabic Headings for quick reference, since the original order of syllables \"is not strictly alphabetic\". Another feature of the new edition is indicating all cases of the unstressed neutral tone.\n\nReception \nMathews' Chinese–English Dictionary has generally been well received but some authors have criticized lexicographical shortcomings. On one hand, Noel Stock, the University of Toledo scholar of Ezra Pound (who refers to Mathews in The Cantos \"Rock-Drill\" section), says Mathews's dictionary \"is probably known by every westerner who undertakes Chinese, as well as by many Chinese themselves\"; but on the other, the American scholar of Chinese literature David R. Knechtges says it \"does not always give the correct or current pronunciation for many characters\".\n\nThe Australian National University historian of China C. P. Fitzgerald says a user of Mathews's dictionary will be struck by \"the deep scholarship, the care and the accuracy of the man who produced this monument of learning\". Mathews has a \"peculiar kind of immortality\" among those who use his work, \"one does not say Mathews' Chinese–English Dictionary but simply, 'I must look up that in Mathews'. Mathews, in fact, is a household word to the Sinologist, an indispensable adjunct to his work\".\n\nThe University of California, Berkeley sinologist Edward H. Schafer made detailed criticisms of Mathews's dictionary. First, he used it to illustrate how an ideal dictionary of classical Chinese could \"improve on vague, conventional equivalents given in most dictionaries\"; while Mathews's gives ch'iung2 瓊 \"A red stone. Excellent; beautiful.\" (no. 1245), Schafer translates \"rose-gem (cf. rhodonite; rose quartz); carbuncle (possibly an archaic word for \"garnet\" or \"spinel\"; overtones of classic, divine and fairy beauty.\" Second, Schafer wrote two supplements noting mistranslations and omissions in Mathews, for example, fang 舫 \"A large boat. Two boats lashed together\" (1814) is more accurately translated \"rectangular, scowlike barge, usually with deckhouse\".\n\nThe American sinologist Jerry Norman says that from a lexicographic point of view, \"Mathews' dictionary was no advance over Giles'\" and its only real advantage was that it was more compact and up-to-date with modern terminology. Otherwise, \"it scrambled together without differentiation words from the earliest texts of Chinese literature with contemporary neologisms\". However, the \"most serious problem\" was its treatment of pronunciation. As Yuen Ren Chao's introduction points out, Mathews's dictionary uses three systems of pronunciation, giving the example of HSÜAN for current Peking pronunciation in Wade–Giles, SÜAN and Gwoyeu Romatzyh ㄙㄩㄢ in the obsolete (1920) Guoyln zidian 國音字典 system, and Hsüen in the China Inland Mission system. The result of using three transcription systems, says Norman, is that although the entries are in alphabetic order, \"it is often frustratingly difficult to find a particular entry unless one is familiar with these various systems of transcription\".\n\nThe lexicographer Robert Dunn says that despite the fact that many of Mathews's dictionary entries are outdated or obsolete, some have changed meanings today, and numerous new and current Chinese terms are omitted, the reference work \"will doubtless continue to be one of the most widely used by students of Chinese history, literature, thought, and civilization\"..\n\nPaul W. Kroll, Professor of Chinese at the University of Colorado, says the most troubling inadequacy of Mathews's dictionary is that \"it indiscriminately mixes together vocabulary of all periods\", from the ancient Book of Documents to early 20th-century merchant and missionary vocabulary, with the \"unhappy result that students infer all terms and meanings to be equally applicable throughout three thousand years of Chinese history\". Another problem is the seemingly random arrangement of various meanings for any particular word, leading the user to a \"pick-and-choose approach\".\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n\nFootnotes\n\nFurther reading\n Astor, Wally G.

{"title": "History of petroleum industry in Iraq", "desc": "\n\nEarly History: The Ottoman Empire\nIn ancient times Plutarch wrote of oil bubbling from the ground near Kirkuk, but oil exploration does not begin until the 20th century when the Ottoman Empire granted a concession allowing William Knox D'Arcy to explore oil fields in the territories which, after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, became the modern countries of Iran and Iraq. Though the company, called African and Eastern Concession Ltd, was unable to find oil at first, D'Arcy and other European partners founded the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) in 1912.\n\nTPC was formed with the purpose of acquiring concessions from the Ottoman Empire to explore for oil in Mesopotamia. The owners were a group of large European companies: Deutsche Bank; the Anglo Saxon Oil Company, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell; the National Bank of Turkey, a British concern; and Turkish-born Armenian businessman Calouste Gulbenkian. The driving force behind TPC's creation was Gulbenkian, while the largest single shareholder was the British Government-controlled Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which held 50% of the shares by 1914. TPC received a promise of a concession from the Ottoman government but the outbreak of World War I in 1914 put a stop to all exploration plans.\n\nAftermath of World War I\nAfter the partition of the Ottoman Empire, the British gained control of Mosul in 1921, and the British-backed Faisal I of Iraq became the first King of Iraq.\n\nIn 1925, TPC obtained a 75-year concession to explore for oil in exchange for a promise that the Iraqi government would receive a royalty for every ton of oil extracted. A well at Baba Gurgur was located by geologist J.M. Muir just north of Kirkuk. Drilling started, and in the early hours of 14 October 1927 oil was struck. Many tons of oil were spilled before the gushing well was brought under control, and the oil field soon proved to be extensive.\n\nDiscovery of oil in Kirkuk hastened the negotiations over the composition of TPC, and on 31 July 1928 shareholders signed a formal partnership agreement to include the Near East Development Corporation (NEDC) — an American consortium of five large US oil companies that included Standard Oil of New Jersey, Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), Gulf Oil, the Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company, and Atlantic Richfield Co. (By 1935 only Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of New York were left).\n\nThe agreement was called the Red Line Agreement for the \"red line\" drawn around the former boundaries of the Ottoman Empire (with the exception of Kuwait), and it effectively bound the partners to act together within the red line. Writer and former IPC employee Stephen Hemsley Longrigg noted that \"[T]he Red Line Agreement, variously assessed as a sad case of wrongful cartelization or as an enlightened example of international co‑operation and fair-sharing, was to hold the field for twenty years and in large measure determined the pattern and tempo of oil development over a large part of the Middle East\".\n\nTPC shares were held in the following proportions: 23.75% each to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Royal Dutch/Shell, the Compagnie Française des Pétroles (CFP), and the NEDC; the remaining 5% went to Calouste Gulbenkian. In 1929, the TPC was renamed the Iraq Petroleum Company.\n\nBetween 1925 and 1931 the government of Iraq received a lump sum payment of £400,000, but after 1931 the government was paid a royalty of 4 gold shillings per ton of crude oil produced. (This royalty was increased to six shillings in August 1950.) In 1931, the Iraqi government and IPC reached an agreement for a new 70 year concession, in exchange for increased payments to Iraq and an agreement that two pipelines to the Mediterranean would be built by 1935. By this time the Mosul Oil Company was already operated by IPC, and when the company was granted a third concession in 1938 the Basrah Petroleum Company was created to develop assets in Iraq's southern regions.\n\nThe Red Line Agreement lasted until 1948 when two of the American partners broke free. During the period, IPC monopolized oil exploration inside the Red Line; excluding Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, where ARAMCO (formed in 1944 by renaming of the Saudi subsidiary of Standard Oil of California (Socal)) and Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) respectively held controlling position.\n\nIraqi Petroleum Company\nFollowing the creation of the State of Israel the Iraq-Haifa pipeline was shut down, and in its place a new line was built from Kirkuk to the Syrian Mediterranean port of Baniyas. The pipelines were closed between November 1956 and March 1957 when Syrian pumping stations were destroyed during the Suez crisis, which caused a financial crisis in Iraq. Iraq could not transport its oil through the Persian Gulf while the Suez Canal remained closed, so the closure of the Mediterranean pipelines meant Iraqi oil production ground to a standstill.\n\nAfter Muhammad Mossadegh nationalized the oil industry in Iran, IPC agreed to accept an \"equal profit sharing\" arrangement in 1952. Instead of a flat royalty payment, Iraq would be paid 12.5% of the sale price of each barrel. However, foreign company control of Iraq's oil assets was unpopular and in 1958 Abd al-Karim Qasim overthrew Faisal II of Iraq. After seizing control of the Iraqi government, Qasim demanded better terms from IPC but decided against nationalization of Iraq's petroleum assets.\n\nIn 1961 Iraq passed Public Law 80 whereby Iraq expropriated 95% of IPC's concessions and the Iraq National Oil Company was created and empowered to develop the assets seized from IPC under Law 80. This arrangement continued in 1970 when the government demanded even more control over IPC, eventually nationalizing IPC after negotiations between the company and the government broke down. By this time the Ba'ath Party was in power in Iraq and Saddam Hussein was its de facto ruler, although Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr did not formally step down as President until 1979.\n\nIraq War and Post-War developments\nIn February 2007, the Iraqi cabinet approved a draft law that would distribute oil revenues to the various regions and provinces of Iraq based on population, and would also give regional oil companies the authority to enter into contractual arrangements directly with foreign companies concerning the exploration and development of oil fields. Iraqis remained divided over provisions allowing regional governments to enter into contracts directly with foreign companies; while strongly supported by Kurds, Sunni Arabs wanted the Oil Ministry to retain signing power. As a compromise the draft law proposed that a new body called the Federal Oil and Gas Council would be created that could, in some circumstances, prevent execution of contracts signed by regional governments. This arrangement would undo the nationalization of the Iraqi oil industry that dates back to 1972.\n\nUnder Article I of the 2010 Law of Income Taxation on Foreign Oil Companies Working in Iraq, there is a 35% tax on \"income earned in Iraq from the contracts signed with the Foreign Oil Companies, their subsidiaries, branches, or offices and their subcontractors working in Iraq in the field of oil and gas extraction and production and the relevant industries\". The production contracts, which foreign oil companies enter into with the Iraqi federal or regional governments, often include revenue-sharing terms as well.\n\nAdditionally, in the last few years oil production in Iraq has increased rapidly and seems to be headed in even more of a direction where it will be even more heavily relied on.\n\nReferences\n\nIraq\nOttoman Iraq\n20th century in Iraqi Kurdistan\n21st century in Iraqi Kurdistan\n20th century in Iraq\n21st century in Iraq\n19th century in the Ottoman Empire"}
